\title{Land Expectation Value (LEV) for Multiple Timber Rotations}
\usage{
landExpectVal(FutureValue, Age, Discount)
}
\arguments{
\item{FutureValue}{Numeric. The total future value of the standing timber at the specified rotation age.}

\item{Age}{Numeric. The rotation age (in years) at which the standing timber value (FutureValue) is evaluated.}

\item{Discount}{Numeric. The discount rate (as a decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5\%). This rate represents the opportunity cost of capital.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The Land Expectation Value (LEV), which represents the value of the timberland over infinite rotations, discounted back to the present.
}
\description{
This function estimates the Land Expectation Value (LEV) for a stand of timber that can be harvested in perpetuity (i.e., multiple rotations).
It calculates the present value of a future revenue stream from timber harvests, assuming infinite rotations, and discounts these future values back to the present.
}
\details{
The LEV formula assumes that after each harvest, the land will be restocked (natural or planted) and future harvests will continue indefinitely.
The LEV is particularly useful for forestry management when determining the long-term value of land that will continue producing timber.

The formula used is known as the Faustmann Formula:
\deqn{LEV = \frac{FutureValue}{(1 + Discount)^{Age} - 1}}
where:
\itemize{
  \item FutureValue: The value of the standing timber at the end of the rotation.
  \item Age: The rotation age of the timber.
  \item Discount: The discount rate used to value future revenues.
}
}
\examples{
# Compare Present Value and Land Expectation Value

# Present Value of a one-time future cash flow from a timber harvest in 40 years
Flow <- 1960
Year <- 40
Discount <- 0.06
present_value_result <- presentValue(Flow, Year, Discount)
present_value_result

# Land Expectation Value for infinite rotations, with the same timber value and rotation age
Age <- 40
FutureValue <- 1960
land_expect_value_result <- landExpectVal(FutureValue, Age, Discount)
land_expect_value_result

# The Present Value result reflects the one-time cash flow, while the Land Expectation Value
# reflects the perpetual nature of timber harvests over infinite rotations.
