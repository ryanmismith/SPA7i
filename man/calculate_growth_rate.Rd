\title{Calculate Gaussian-Based Growth Rate by Township}
\usage{
calculate_growth_rate(township = "T13R5", hw_volume, sw_volume)
}
\arguments{
\item{township}{Character. The stand's township code (e.g., `"T13R5"`, `"Davis"`). 
Used to assign the growth curve parameters via \code{\link{assign_spa_unit}}.}

\item{hw_volume}{Numeric. Hardwood volume in cords/acre.}

\item{sw_volume}{Numeric. Softwood volume in cords/acre.}
}
\value{
Numeric. Predicted annual growth rate (cords/acre/year), calculated 
as the weighted mean of hardwood and softwood Gaussian growth curves.
}
\description{
`calculate_growth_gaussian()` estimates annual stand-level growth using a 
species-specific Gaussian model. Each township is mapped to a case unit 
(SP, RY, AE, AW), which determines the hardwood and softwood growth curve parameters.
}
\details{
Growth is calculated independently for hardwood and softwood using the function:

\deqn{G(V) = a \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{V - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)}

where:

- \( G(V) \) is the growth at volume \( V \),
- \( a \) is the peak growth rate (tempered from original fits),
- \( \mu \) is the volume at which peak growth occurs, and
- \( \sigma \) controls the spread of the growth curve.

The final growth rate is the weighted average of hardwood and softwood growth, 
based on their proportion of total volume:

\deqn{
\text{growth}_\text{total} = 
\frac{V_{\mathrm{HW}}}{V} \cdot G_{\mathrm{HW}} + 
\frac{V_{\mathrm{SW}}}{V} \cdot G_{\mathrm{SW}}
}

Parameters are derived from nonlinear least squares fits to empirical data 
and then scaled (a Ã— 0.9) to temper model optimism based on field observations.

If total volume is zero or negative, the function returns 0.

\examples{
# Pure softwood stand in high-productivity township
calculate_growth_gaussian("T13R5", hw_volume = 0, sw_volume = 30)

# Mixed stand with moderate volumes
calculate_growth_gaussian("Davis", hw_volume = 10, sw_volume = 10)

# Edge case: no volume
calculate_growth_gaussian("T15R13", hw_volume = 0, sw_volume = 0)
