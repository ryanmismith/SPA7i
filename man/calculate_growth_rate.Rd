\title{Calculate Growth Rate}
\usage{
calculate_growth_rate(current_volume, max_volume, start_rate, min_rate)
}
\arguments{
\item{current_volume}{Numeric, the current volume of the stand (e.g., cords/acre).}

\item{max_volume}{Numeric, the maximum allowable volume for the stand.}

\item{start_rate}{Numeric, the initial growth rate when the current volume is below 14 cords.}

\item{min_rate}{Numeric, the minimum growth rate when the current volume reaches or exceeds the maximum.}
}
\value{
Numeric, the calculated growth rate based on the current volume and maximum volume.
The result is constrained between the `min_rate` and `start_rate`.
}
\description{
This function calculates the non-linear declining growth rate as the volume approaches its maximum.
If the current volume is equal to or greater than the maximum volume, the minimum growth rate is returned.
Otherwise, it uses a quadratic decline formula to interpolate the growth rate based on the current and maximum volumes.
}
\details{
The function implements a non-linear interpolation model to determine the growth rate. As the current volume
increases towards the maximum volume, the growth rate declines quadratically. The growth rate never goes below
the minimum rate specified.

The calculation uses a quadratic interpolation:
\deqn{rate = start\_rate - (start\_rate - min\_rate) \times (decline\_factor^{2.2})}
where \deqn{decline\_factor = (current\_volume - 14) / (max\_volume - 14)}.

The function ensures that the growth rate does not fall below the specified `min_rate`.
